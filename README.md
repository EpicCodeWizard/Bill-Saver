This app uses many different technologies:
- Flask: Main server routing. Flask is a very fun library to use, with it's minimal syntax and many helper packages.
- Replit: Server hosting. Replit's unlimited server hosting gave us peace of mind when developing the application.
- Hedera: Main file storage. Using `FileCreateTransaction` and `FileContentsQuery`, we efficiently store files on the Hedera blockchain. Chosing it was a wise decision as it provided a lot of security.
- Google Cloud: Database. Google Cloud's secure and easy to use database gave us peace of mind, knowing our data was secure.
